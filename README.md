# "An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns."
Preforming analysis for Louise on Kickstarter Campaign data as she was looking to start up a campaign for a theatre in GB. We found that the pledged number for the failed campaigns was around the original number she proposed of $10,000. However, sucessful campaigns stayed at around half of that. I would reccommend she set a more conservative goal of around $5,000.
